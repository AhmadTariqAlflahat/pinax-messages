Getting Started
===============


Getting started with ``user-messages`` is easy.  First you need to install it::
    
    $ pip install user-messages

Next add ``"user_messages"`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # some cool apps
        
        "user_messages",
        
        # other cool apps
    ]

Finally add the ``user-messages`` URLs to your URLconf::
    
    urlpatterns = patterns("",
        # some cool URLs
        
        (r"^messages/", include("user_messages.urls")),
        
        # some other cool URLs
    )

Now all you need to do is wire up some templates.
